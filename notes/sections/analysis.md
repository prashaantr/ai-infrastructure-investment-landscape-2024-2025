# Experimental Analysis

## Overview

This analysis follows rigorous scientific methodology to examine experimental results and draw evidence-based conclusions about AI infrastructure investment landscape patterns. The analysis framework implements comprehensive statistical testing, pattern recognition, and hypothesis evaluation procedures.

## Methodology

### Statistical Analysis Framework

Our analysis employs multiple statistical approaches to ensure robust findings:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Central tendencies, variability measures, and distribution characteristics
2. **Inferential Statistics**: Hypothesis testing using appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, etc.)
3. **Effect Size Calculations**: Cohen's d, eta-squared, and other effect size measures to assess practical significance
4. **Confidence Intervals**: 95% confidence intervals for all point estimates
5. **Multiple Comparison Corrections**: Bonferroni or FDR corrections when appropriate

### Data Quality Assessment

Before analysis, we implement strict quality control measures:

- **Completeness Check**: Ensure all required variables are present
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle extreme values using IQR method and z-scores
- **Normality Testing**: Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
- **Missing Data Analysis**: Pattern analysis and appropriate imputation strategies

## Current Status

### Experiments Available
- **Total Experiments**: 1
- **Completed Experiments**: 0 
- **Example/Template Entries**: 1

### Analysis Results

Currently, the repository contains only template/example experiment data. No real experimental results are available for statistical analysis at this time.

## Framework for Future Analysis

### When Experiments Are Conducted

The following analyses will be automatically performed:

#### 1. Primary Hypothesis Testing
- **Investment Pattern Analysis**: Statistical tests comparing investment volumes across infrastructure categories
- **Temporal Trend Analysis**: Time series analysis of investment patterns over quarters/years
- **Geographic Distribution**: Chi-square tests for investment distribution across regions
- **Technology Sector Analysis**: ANOVA comparing investment levels across AI technology sectors

#### 2. Secondary Analyses
- **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between investment metrics and market indicators
- **Regression Modeling**: Predictive models for investment outcomes
- **Cluster Analysis**: Identification of investment pattern groups
- **Survival Analysis**: Time-to-funding analysis for different investment types

#### 3. Visualization Suite
- **Distribution Plots**: Histograms and density plots for all continuous variables
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Visual representation of variable relationships
- **Time Series Plots**: Temporal trends with confidence bands
- **Geographic Maps**: Spatial distribution of investments
- **Box Plots**: Comparative analysis across categories

## Statistical Power and Sample Size

### Power Analysis Framework
- **Minimum Detectable Effect**: Cohen's d = 0.5 (medium effect size)
- **Statistical Power**: 0.80 (80% power to detect true effects)
- **Alpha Level**: 0.05 (5% Type I error rate)
- **Required Sample Size**: Will be calculated based on effect size expectations

### Effect Size Interpretation
- **Small Effect**: d = 0.2, ·² = 0.01, r = 0.1
- **Medium Effect**: d = 0.5, ·² = 0.06, r = 0.3
- **Large Effect**: d = 0.8, ·² = 0.14, r = 0.5

## Quality Assurance

### Reproducibility Measures
- **Seed Setting**: Fixed random seeds for all stochastic analyses
- **Version Control**: All analysis code versioned and documented
- **Environment Documentation**: Complete package versions recorded
- **Code Review**: Peer review of all statistical analysis code

### Validation Procedures
- **Cross-Validation**: K-fold cross-validation for predictive models
- **Bootstrap Sampling**: Non-parametric confidence intervals
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Robustness checks with different assumptions
- **Replication**: Independent analysis verification

## Interpretation Framework

### Statistical Significance vs. Practical Significance
All results will be interpreted considering both:
- **Statistical Significance**: p-values and confidence intervals
- **Practical Significance**: Effect sizes and real-world implications
- **Clinical/Economic Significance**: Business relevance of findings

### Causal Inference Guidelines
- **Association vs. Causation**: Clear distinction in all interpretations
- **Confounding Variables**: Identification and control strategies
- **Temporal Relationships**: Proper time ordering for causal claims
- **External Validity**: Generalizability considerations

## Limitations and Assumptions

### Current Limitations
1. **No Experimental Data**: Analysis pending completion of experiments
2. **Template Structure**: Current setup is framework only
3. **Validation Pending**: Statistical procedures require real data for validation

### Future Considerations
1. **Sample Size**: Adequate power for planned analyses
2. **Data Quality**: Systematic quality control procedures
3. **Multiple Testing**: Appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons
4. **Effect Size**: Practical significance assessment

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Conduct Experiments**: Execute planned experimental protocols
2. **Data Collection**: Implement systematic data gathering procedures
3. **Quality Control**: Establish data validation checkpoints
4. **Analysis Pipeline**: Test statistical analysis framework with pilot data

### Long-term Analysis Plan
1. **Primary Analysis**: Test main hypotheses with appropriate statistical methods
2. **Secondary Analysis**: Exploratory analysis for hypothesis generation
3. **Meta-Analysis**: Synthesis of results across multiple experiments
4. **Publication Preparation**: Statistical results for peer review

## Conclusion

The analysis framework is established and ready for implementation once experimental data becomes available. The methodology follows rigorous scientific standards and will provide robust evidence for conclusions about AI infrastructure investment patterns.

**Status**: Framework complete, awaiting experimental data for analysis execution.
